# 👋 Hi there

My name is Engin Polat (pronouns, he/him 🙋‍♂️), I'm based in Seattle area, beautiful city Sammamish 🌅

I'm a versatile Software Engineer with over 20 years of comprehensive experience, focused on working with challenging projects and learning while working.

## 💼 Job

I'm a Senior Software Engineer in [Microsoft](https://github.com/microsoft) who loves open source. I actively contribute to projects that make cloud development smoother for everyone.

### Why do I work for Microsoft

I work for Microsoft because it is a great place to work where I can use my skills and talents to make a difference. Microsoft offers excellent job satisfaction, a chance to work on cutting-edge technology, and a chance to make a real difference in the world.

I enjoy working on projects that are important to the company and that have a real impact on the world. I feel that my work is meaningful and that I am making a contribution to the company.

I like the constantly learning new things and working on new projects.

Microsoft is also a great place to work because of the people. The people at Microsoft are some of the smartest, most talented, and most driven people I have ever met. I feel fortunate to be able to work with such talented and passionate people.

### What is my job in Microsoft

I'm working with the biggest enterprises and communities all around the world, trying to solve their most sophisticated problems with scalable and future-proof solutions 👍

## 🔭 I'm currently working on

[Bicep](https://github.com/azure/bicep): Contributor to Microsoft's Azure IaC language Bicep (written in C#) – helping improve the tooling that deploys Azure resources declaratively. (Basically, making Azure infrastructure-as-code easier 💪)

[Power Platform Terraform Provider](https://github.com/microsoft/terraform-provider-power-platform): Co-developer of the Power Platform Terraform Provider (in Go), bringing Infrastructure-as-Code to Power Platform services. It's in preview, but we're automating _ALL_ the things in the cloud.

[Retrospective Extension](https://github.com/microsoft/vsts-extension-retrospectives): Maintainer of the Retrospectives extension for Azure DevOps which is available on the [Azure DevOps Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-devlabs.team-retrospectives) (TypeScript/Node) – a plugin used by thousands of teams to run better sprint retrospectives (84k+ installs and counting! 🚀)

Skills: Fluent in C#, TypeScript, and Go – I enjoy switching between building robust backends, slick web apps, and cloud automation scripts. Also experienced in designing resilient, high-performance systems (ask me about keeping services up 24/7 😊)
